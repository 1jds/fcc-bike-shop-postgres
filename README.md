# Free Code Camp Exercise: Create a Bike Shop with Postgres and Bash Scripting

This repo contains the code of my solution to the Free Code Camp exercises to create a small 'bike shop' using Postgres and Bash scripting.

How this could be extended:
- Obviously, this is a very simple example of Postgres and Bash in action.
- Further functionality could be added to, for example, handle inputing first names and last names into separate table columns in the database.
- Further functionality could be added to allow for the current inventory of bikes on loan/in stock to be checked through the command-line interface.
- Functionality could be added to request reserves on bikes currently out on loan, etc.
